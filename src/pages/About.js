          <p>
            My name is Kyra Hamerling-Potts and I am a full-stack software
            engineer specializing in JavaScript, React and React Native, Python,
            and Flask. I am a recent graduate of Flatiron School's Software
            Engineering Bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was born in Washington, DC, and have had an interest in STEM
            fields and social sciences from a young age. I studied psychology
            and computer science at Washington University in St. Louis, where I
            was exposed to multiple coding languages, frameworks, and projects.
            I spent much of my time there conducting my own psychological
            research on emotion regulation and attachment.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I also enjoy homing in on solutions using algorithmic
            thinking, data manipulation, and visual organization. This mindset
            has been in my veins throughout my life. Iâ€™ve seen the evolution of
            this passion, from arranging and organizing objects at a young age
            to finding efficient solutions to problems and visual design. After
            years of thinking about programming as a hobby, making it my
            permanent career was the right course correction for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, flipping furniture, and
            discovering new recipes. Whether in a technical or research
            capacity, I show open-mindedness, empathy, and tactfulness towards
            each conversation and relationship. In my next role, I hope to work
            with equity-minded teams that foster productivity and warm
            communication.
